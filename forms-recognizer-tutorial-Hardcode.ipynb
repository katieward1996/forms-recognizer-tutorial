    "## Training a Form Recognizer model and extracting form data (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you start\n",
    " \n",
    "Install Python. Do this either via the Microsoft Store (recommended) or via https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "***\n",
    "Install a Python interpreter, preferrably Anaconda via https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",
    "***\n",
    "Install the required modules. To do this:\n",
    "1. Launch the Anaconda prompt\n",
    "2. Run the command `pip install azure`\n",
    "3. Run the command `pip install python-dotenv`\n",
    "***\n",
    "Have data to train your model. You must have either:\n",
    "* A set of at least five forms of the same type. They can be of different file types but must be the same type of document; OR\n",
    "* A single empty form with two filled-in forms. The empty form's file name needs to include the word \"empty\". \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up your Form Recognizer resource group\n",
    "Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and create a new resource group to store your Form Recognizer resource and a storage container. Once you have created the resource group, create a new Form Recognizer resource. Then, create a Storage Account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have established the resources that we need, we can go ahead and find and save our secrets. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving your key and endpoint values\n",
    "From within you Form Recognizer resource, select the **Quick start** tab to view your subscription data. Save the values **Key** and **Endpoint** to a temporary location, such as a .txt file. Make sure that you label the key and endpoint clearly so you can tell them apart later. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving your SAS URL \n",
    "Navigate to your Storage Account resource. Open the **Storage Explore** tab and right-click on your container. Select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure that the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section and paste this into your .txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have access to the **Storage Explorer** tab, then navigate further down to the **Shared access signature** tab (under **Settings**). Make sure that the **_all_** checkboxes are selected, leave all other settings as they are. Press **Generate SAS and connection string**. Copy the **Blob service SAS URL** and save it to your .txt file. You will have to alter the SAS URL so that it includes the name of your container - see the note below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Note_**: Make sure that your SAS URL is of the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`. If you have gotten your URL via the **Shared access signature** tab, your URL will _not_ include the `<container name>` so you will need to add this in order for your URL to work correctly. You can check the name of your container by going to your Storage Account resource, and navigating to **Blob service** > **Containers** in the side bar. \n"

The values you need to change are listed at the beginning of each block of code. Please read these changes and alter the variables as necessary before running the notebook.\n",
